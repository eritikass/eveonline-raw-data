    "description": "The history of Cache is shrouded in mystery, even among the highest levels of the four Empires. No record remains of its original explorers, or what they were after. The region stretches out into the eastern darkness like a mangled claw, stringing far-flung stars into a twisted necklace of frozen tears. What did the nameless voyagers hope to find out in the cold tomb of trackless space? And given the abrupt end to which the region comes, did they find it, or did some darker fate befall them?",
