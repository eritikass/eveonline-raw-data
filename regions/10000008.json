    "description": "Scalding Pass is a vast stellar nursery, the birth place of stars. A harsh and unforgiving region of space home to violent ion storms and rocked by intense solar winds, the Pass is littered with the wrecks of ships that were blindsided by the unpredictable dangers this region holds.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some who manage to find solace and safety in such a tumultuous place. The Cartel is rumored to have many outlying bases in the region, masked by stellar phenomena, and in recent times many capsuleer groups have braved its burning embrace in pursuit of their dark dreams of power.",
