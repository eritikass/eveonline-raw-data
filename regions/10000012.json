    "description": "Once we were mighty,\r\nStars bent to our will,\r\nOur reach was infinite,\r\nOur power incontestable,\r\nWith outstretched hands we tried,\r\nTo touch the face of perfection,\r\nBut we came too close,\r\nTo that which is not due mortals,\r\nAnd our punishment is our curse,\r\nOur endless sorrow.\r\n<i>- Translation of an old Jovian poem</i><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Perfection ain't all it's cracked up to be\"\r\n<i>- Angel saying </i>",
