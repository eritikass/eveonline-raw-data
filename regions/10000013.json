    "description": "At the heart of the Drone Regions subcluster, Malpais quickly gained a reputation as a graveyard for the unwary, its twisting routes leading many eager explorers astray in the early days of the capsuleer expansion into the region. Death by rogue drones was before long joined by death by piracy and war. As capsuleers settled into the patterns of behavior seen in so many other outer regions, the region's reputation led many to avoid it in favor of opportunities elsewhere. ",
