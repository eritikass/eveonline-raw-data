    "description": "When Pure Blind was first properly mapped, it was earmarked to become the Caldari's Fourth District. A long chain of logistical and political difficulties ensued, and the plan was shelved numerous times but never quite died. Recent population pressures brought the plans back from death yet again, and for a while it seemed as if they might finally go ahead. However, it turned out that the moment had already passed - the region was now home to both the Caldari Loyalist forces of Mordu's famous Legion and the avowedly neutral Servant Sisters of EVE, and the remaining volumes were gripped tightly by various capsuleer factions who were undeterred by its comparative lack of resources. Frustrated, the State turned its attentions elsewhere, and it seems that Pure Blind will remain a turgid melting pot of competing traditional and capsuleer forces for the foreseeable future.",
