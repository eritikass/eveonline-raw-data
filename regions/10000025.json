    "description": "Immensea was mapped entirely by successive generations of an Ammatar Wayfinder clan. Driven by tales of massive clusters of Arkanor in the deep south, they forged deeper and deeper into unexplored territory, mapping out a long corridor of space. Eventually they encountered one of the many great voids littering the southern expanses and could go no further. Failing to locate precious minerals in any extraordinary volumes, they reluctantly turned back and returned to civilized space, content with the knowledge that they had pushed further south than any previous human. \r\n\r\nIt was only on their repatriation that they learnt of the Amarrian expedition launched many years later that, capitalizing on a number of technological advancements, had pushed down a parallel route through what is now Tenerifis, penetrating almost ten light years further into uncharted territory and returning decades earlier. The name of the clan who mounted the expedition is now lost to history.",
