    "description": "Considered by many to be the gateway to the Drone Regions, Etherium Reach rapidly became extensively colonized by those drawn to the opportunities opened up in the newly-accessible systems. Briefly, the Minmatar Republic pondered its strategic advantage over most other empires, with proximity to the regions through relatively short routes into the Reach no doubt tempting. \r\n\r\nThe Skarkon Incident showed how tenuous its advantage really was before other matters demanded the full attention of the Minmatar tribes. Even so, some Thukker caravan masters continue to maintain an interest in an area abutting onto their Great Wildands domains and have become authorities on the rogue drones. Expertise on the uses to which rogue drone parts can be put is not the least of the advantages the wily Thukker derive from their age old traditions of exploration and specialization.",
