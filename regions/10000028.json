    "description": "The common ground of the Heath, away from the bustling crowds of Heimatar and Metropolis, was in the days of the Elders committed as neutral ground between the Matari Tribes, to be claimed by none and developed by all.\r\n\r\nIts scarcity of resources, as well as its proximity to the untamed reaches of Great Wildlands and the hated space of the turncoat Ammatar, have all diminished its value in the eyes of modern Minmatar society. Coupled with barriers imposed by bordering singularities and voids, this has created a region with an unsettled history and an uncertain future.\r\n\r\nToday, as legitimate claimant to the title of \"center of the cluster,\" and as the site of the Golgothan Fields, the region still evokes great national pride, but despite this it remains mostly undeveloped. Indeed, in recent years the outcast Thukker Tribe have been making inroads, which does little to enhance the region's already tarnished image.",
