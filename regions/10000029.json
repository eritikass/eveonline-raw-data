    "description": "Despite being overrun by Guristas, Geminate is home to the Society of Conscious Thought. Their headquarters are located in the middle of the region, quite a distance from civilized space. Many contend that the Society's most gifted students are brought here to learn the innermost secrets of the Society, far from the prying eyes of their parents and the Empires. Though the claims appear quite outlandish, the fact that the Guristas give the station a wide berth has lead to rumors that the Society isn't nearly as passive as many think.",
