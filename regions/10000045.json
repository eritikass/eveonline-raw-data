    "description": "Tenal has long been a refuge for those wishing to stray far away from the State, for one reason or another. The journey there is perilous due to the intervening Guristas territories, but that remains a major element of its appeal, and many pioneers, hermits and less reputable travelers have risked everything to travel to this quiet backwater and make it their home. Several Caldari mystics have claimed that Tenal is the place that one should travel to in order to come face to face with the Starsmith, although whether this is in reference to the view into space from its outermost systems or the likely outcome of trying to negotiate the dangers of the route has never been made clear.",
