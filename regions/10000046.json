    "description": "A foreboding area of space long considered to be the backwater of the galaxy, Fade was once the home of no less than a dozen small competing pirate sects. Never managing to pose much of a threat to Empire space due to their frequent clashes, they were mostly ignored. That is, until the Serpentis came to be and began expanding its power base.\r\n\r\nSeeing a region ripe for the picking, the Serpentis began to insinuate its people into several of the most powerful factions, playing them off against each other until they were sufficiently weakened both politically and militarily that moving in and taking control was simply a formality.  This audacious move put the Serpentis firmly on the map of even the major Empires.",
