    "description": "Despite belonging to the Heir House known as the \"Old Imperial Family,\" Kador is one of the least developed regions in the Empire. The Kador Family has not been progressive in encouraging trade and investment into the region, favoring older, established Holder families with proven bloodlines and heritage. Though in many ways a musty embodiment of the old ways, Kador may be one of the few parts of Amarr territory where a traveler can still get a glimpse of the grand and majestic Empire of days gone by.",
