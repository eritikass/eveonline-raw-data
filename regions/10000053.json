    "description": "A natural destination for explorers and adventurers of all kinds, Cobalt Edge juts up and out of the Drone Regions subcluster, thrusting a long wicked blade of stars out into intergalactic space. Its status as a prominence in the local geography seems to have attracted the attentions of some of the more adventurous rogue drones, as well as capsuleers motivated by wanderlust as well as greed for untapped resources. \r\n\r\nMany strange tales have been brought back from the Edge to the stopping points and waystations of the growing colonies in the neighboring regions: tales of rare solitary drones, specialized beyond normal experience, wandering the systems; stories of these lone wanderers being hunted by packs of 'normal' rogue drones; weird rumors of the 'lonesome ones' actually helping capsuleers in dire circumstances. Most of these tales, not least those claiming aid from rogues, are dismissed out of hand. Yet they persist and are joined by more every time an explorer from the Cobalt Edge sets down in a bar to drink and talk.",
