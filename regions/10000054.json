    "description": "\"It has been a long, tedious journey. Whilst my cartographer maintains that the distance from the central Throne Worlds is not great, the travails of getting here were, for many reasons, too tiresome to enumerate. The mineral survey report is also grim. It seems the riches we were led to expect are nowhere to be found. This region seems literally devoid of anything of worth, a desert with no oasis in sight, where even my faith seems to shrivel and die. Perhaps others will find worth here. I cannot.\"\r\n\r\n<i>- From the journal of Soruma Aquiun, Commander 51st Exploration Corps.</i>",
