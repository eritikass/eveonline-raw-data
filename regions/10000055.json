    "description": "The northern hinterland of Branch remains a dismal and largely desolate region, despite its considerable mineral wealth. Unlike the rest of the densely-packed northern cluster, Branch and its neighbor Tenal occupy a sector of space located behind the vast tracts of Guristas-infested Venal, making access to them even more hazardous than usual. Perversely, this inaccessibility is also one of its greatest attractions: many capsuleer regimes have found this isolated fastness perfect for establishing the fortified core of their dominion.",
