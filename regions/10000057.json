    "description": "Before the discovery of nocxium changed the way industry functioned, the Outer Ring was considered nothing more than an average parcel of space. That was why Outer Ring Excavations was able to get their start here, mining the \"low end\" ores while braving unlawful space. But once the process of refining nocxium was discovered, the Outer Ring became a gold mine. Outer Ring Excavations quickly became leaders in the field of asteroid mining. Of course, such wealth always brings challenges.\r\n\r\nFor decades, ORE called Mordu's Angels their closest allies. The highly trained and proficient mercenaries patrolled the Outer Ring for troublemakers, focusing in particular on the Serpentis who made regular raids into the area. The Serpentis had the last laugh, though, when they bought a majority share in ORE. Now the Serpentis prowl the space lanes of the Outer Ring virtually unopposed.",
