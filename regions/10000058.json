    "description": "\"You young pod pilots have it lucky! Why, back in my day, we didn't have these fancy pants lawless regions like Pure Blind and Stain! We had Fountain! We had to go to Fountain! Through Aridia, both ways! And it was infested with Blood Raiders! They stole our blood and we didn't complain. We liked it! Because the other option was going to Providence, and they had Sanshas who stole your BRAIN! So when you're out there, smoking your fancy tobacco, drinking your fancy spiced wine, and mining with your fancy Hulks, remember: it wasn't so long ago that we had to give our first born to the Emperor just for a chance to apply for a permit to mine in Fountain! So be thankful for what you have!\"\r\n\r\n<i>- Old Prospector Yurskeld to anyone who will listen to him.</i>",
