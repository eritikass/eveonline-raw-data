    "description": "Out in Omist, civilization gives way to survival. Here, it is not one corporation against another. It is one tribe fighting in a blood war against another, not out of differing ideologies or any higher reasoning. It is only for the basest necessities of humanity that men wage war in Omist. Such is the way of life on the frontier's frontier. It is dark, brutal, and unforgiving. In a way, Omist is the rest of the galaxy, distilled down to its most elementary nature. Those who can survive and thrive here seem as untamed gods to those who luxuriate in more civilized space.",
